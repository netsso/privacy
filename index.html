Netsso provides its members the facility to connect quickly, easily and reliably to most other places on the Internet, with accessible urls, by simple clicking in Netsso, and from most computers. Users’ data- login and other information related to the urls that users wish to access- is held in encrypted form on Netsso’s database and is made available exclusively to the user, when called up and following authentication of the user. At no stage will Netsso’s administrator or his staff be enabled to decipher the user’s data. That data is decrypted only on the user’s local computer.</p>

                    <p>B.2. Netsso’s technology and programme code contains no method by which Netsso’s own staff or any other persons can decipher user data. All data encrypted by the user- which is mostly an automatic process- on his own computer and then uploaded to the Netsso database stays encrypted in Netsso and can only be decrypted by insertion of the user’s Master password on his own local computer.</p>

                    <p>B.3. User’s themselves are responsible for keeping their own Master Password secure. Netsso does not and can not know users’ Master Passwords and cannot restore these passwords to users in the event of their loss.</p>
                    
                    <p>B.4. Netsso uses the AES and RSA encryption algorithms, also SHA256 hash algorithm is used.</p>
                   

                    <p>B.5. As an Irish company, Netsso Ltd, operators of Netsso, diligently observe the laws of Ireland concerning security of data, data retention, data privacy and encryption (and notes that the use of strong encryption is specifically permitted in Ireland).</p>
                    

                    <p>B.6. Netsso’s code has no “back door” or similar secret channel by which users’ data may be copied or diverted.</p>
                    

                    <p>B.7. Netsso Ltd does not ban any specific websites from access via the Netsso system. However, users are not permitted to use the Netsso service in furtherance of illegal activities, including those activities related to the dissemination of libellous material concerning individuals or institutions; or the dissemination or distribution of material designed to incite violence against others; or the promotion of terrorism or other serious crimes such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, child pornography, etc. The activities which are not permitted in Netsso also include the distribution of spam and organised attempts to illegally hack into computers.</p>
                    

                    <p>B.8 Netsso Ltd reserves the right to immediately terminate, without notice, the membership of individuals or organisations who can be demonstrated to be engaged in crimes and offences mentioned in B.7 and will pass their data, if required, albeit encrypted, to appropriate police authorities.</p>
                    

                    <p>B.9. Except as provided for in B.8., Netsso Ltd will never delete user’s data from the system without providing a minimum of one months notice by email to the user in question.

                    <p>B.10. Netsso collects some personal information from users, mainly, or exclusively at initial registration. That data will be kept confidential to Netsso and will not be used by Netsso in such a manner as to reveal the personal identity of individuals. Netsso may aggregate and evaluate the aggregated data in attempts to understand its user base better, and possibly for the direction of advertising and for the selection/provision of user interface languages, and other uses which do not effect users’ privacy.</p>
                    

                    <p>B.11. Netsso will make best efforts to ensure that the service is available for 99% of the time during any year.

                    <p>C.1, The user, upon joining Netsso as a member, must provide accurate, truthful answers to the questions asked in the registration process, including name, city/country of residence, email address, etc.</p>
                    

                    <p>C.2. If the user’s email address should change, the user will notify Netsso, so that any notifications may be sent to the new address.</p>
                                      

                    <p>C.3. The user will take all necessary steps to protect his Master Password and ensure that he does not lose or forget it. The user accepts that Netsso cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from the user’s failure to comply with this security obligation.</p>
                                      

                    <p>C.4. The user will respect the copyright, trade mark and intellectual property rights of Netsso Ltd in relation to the Netsso software and service.</p>
                                        

                    <p>C.5. The user is not permitted to modify, decompile, re-engineer or alter the Netsso software in any way or incorporate Netsso into any other code, or copy or distribute the Netsso code or Netsso’s com object or any accessible part of the Netsso product.</p>
                                        

                    <p>C.6. The user understands Netsso Ltd’s right to institute a charge for the Netsso service, which may currently be free and supported by advertising.

                    <p>C.7. The user is not permitted to re-sell the Netsso service, except when specifically authorised, or to incorporate it in any commercial offers to third parties.</p>
                                        

                    <p>C.8. The user agrees that Netsso Ltd, at its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate a user’s account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of the Account or user’s access to his Account, and the deletion of all data in the Account. (However, a minimum of one months notice will be provided before deletion of such data).</p>
                                        

                    <p>C.9. As security against some unpredictable catastrophe effecting Netsso’s servers, Netsso provides users the possibility to take a copy, encrypted by the user’s Master Password, of all their url login data and other data recorded in the Netsso database. By simple right-click all of a user’s data can be downloaded to a local computer and decrypted later. In this manner Netsso provides a comprehensive backup of a user’s data to the user, at his discretion. The user accepts in these Terms of Service that this system is adequate as far as Netsso’s backup obligations are concerned, and accepts that he is responsible for taking these offline backups of his own data from time to time.</p>
                                        

                    <p>C.10. The user accepts that Netsso warrants only best efforts to ensure a high quality service, and that Netsso, or Netsso Ltd, shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses resulting from any defects, deficiencies or failures in the service. In other words, the user accepts that this service is provided to him at his own risk. (Nevertheless, Netsso Ltd will take all reasonable steps and make every determined effort to ensure that the service is a high quality one, the best available by standards of other suppliers of similar services, and that it is frequently updated with novel technology and features designed to enhance the users experience and satisfaction.)</p>
                                        

                    <p>C.11 The user agrees to indemnify and hold Netsso Ltd harmless from any claim or demand made by any third party in connection with or arising out of the user’s use of the Netsso service, or the user’s violation of any terms or conditions of these Terms of Service, or of applicable laws, or of any rights of another person or entity.
